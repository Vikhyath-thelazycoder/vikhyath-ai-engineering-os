## Security Model

Vikhyath AI Engineering OS is designed with a defense-in-depth security model suited for developer tooling:

### 1. Thin Orchestration (No Daemons, No Background Listeners)
The project contains only static declarative manifests, routing configurations, skills, and validation scripts. There are:
- **No background daemons** or long-running daemon processes.
- **No open network ports** or listening socket servers.
- **No automatic arbitrary code execution** outside the host agent's explicit execution model.

### 2. Cryptographic Dependency Pinning
External capabilities are never referenced via mutable branches (e.g., `main`, `master`) or unverified floating tags. Every external capability registered in `config/capabilities.yaml` and `integrations/*.yaml` is pinned to a full **40-character hexadecimal Git commit SHA**. This protects against upstream tampering, unexpected breaking changes, and supply-chain supply poisoning.

### 3. Strict NO MCP Guarantee
Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers run external processes with system-level access. Vikhyath OS strictly prohibits MCP:
- No `mcpServers` manifests.
- No `.mcp.json` files.
- No MCP dependencies or proxy bridges.
This eliminates MCP-specific attack vectors (such as unauthorized tool invocation, arbitrary command execution, or local socket hijacking).

### 4. Zero Credential Storage
The repository strictly prohibits storing secrets, tokens, API keys, private keys, or environment files. All authentication is handled natively by the user's host environment (Codex, Antigravity, Claude Code).

### 5. Sandboxed Host Execution
Capability activations provide instructional routing guidance to the hosting environment. All file modifications and command executions adhere entirely to the hosting agent's security boundaries and user permission prompts.
