# Vikhyath Testing

1. **Plan:** `vikhyath verify --plan` (default: the working-tree changes; or `--paths <files…>`) lists the checks
   the change needs: the impacted tests by kind (unit, api, integration, idempotency, security, regression) plus
   the project's typecheck, lint and build.
2. **Missing tests first:** every changed behaviour needs a test that fails without the change (bug fixes: write
   the failing regression test before the fix).
3. **Run:** `vikhyath verify --task <T-id>` (or `vikhyath test` for tests only). Failed tests are rerun once;
   a pass on rerun is reported as flaky and still counts as FAILED. A missing tool is BLOCKED, not passed.
4. **Fix and rerun** from the `diagnosis` lines until PASSED; the evidence file
   (`.vikhyath/evidence/<time>.json`) and the plan status (`vikhyath plan set-status <T-id> VERIFIED --evidence <file>`)
   record the result.

Never verify by opening a browser, using Chrome DevTools or taking or reading screenshots. The project's own
headless E2E script runs only with `--include-e2e`. If only a human can judge something (look and feel), report
it as NOT_TESTED, or record a browser exception with `vikhyath verify exception --reason "…"` (the user operates
the browser; nothing is captured).

Verification policy: local test-first (`config/verification.yaml`) — no browser, Chrome DevTools, screenshots or MCP.
