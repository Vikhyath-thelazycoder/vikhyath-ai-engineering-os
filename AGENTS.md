# Agylite — agent instructions

Agylite is a local engineering OS for coding agents. Do not pick skills by hand and do not load every skill:

1. `agylite bootstrap --host <your host>` at the start of a session (compact project state, plan pointer, capability index).
2. `agylite route "<request>" [--paths <files…>]` — the minimum capabilities, their lifecycle and impact step.
3. `agylite context <capability-id>…` — load only what the route selected (L1 cards, L2 sections; L3 only on purpose).
4. Follow the route's `lifecycle`; start existing-project changes with `agylite codebase affected`.
5. Verify with `agylite verify` (local tests, types, lint, build) and record the evidence. Never verify with a browser,
   Chrome DevTools or screenshots (`config/verification.yaml`).
6. Record decisions with `agylite decide add` and progress with `agylite plan set-status`.

Rules: no MCP servers; guidance order is the route's capability order (`config/priorities.yaml`); Simplicity review
only when the user asks; never write into another project; live-website edits need `agylite seo authorize`.

Entry skills: `skills/agylite-*`. Architecture: `docs/architecture/`. If `agylite` is not on PATH, use `bin/agylite`.
