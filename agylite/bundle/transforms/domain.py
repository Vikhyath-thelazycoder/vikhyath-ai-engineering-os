"""Domain adaptation of ADAPT text (P13, D-027, D-035, D-038): applied to every ADAPT file after rendering/rewrites.

1. gstack placeholders the renderer could not recover → OS-native replacement text (no gstack runtime needed).
2. gstack runtime paths: `~/.claude/skills/gstack/<p>` → `$AGYLITE_BUNDLE/files/gstack/<p>` when that file is
   bundled; steps that call gstack's own runtime (bin/ tools, browse/, state root, telemetry, upgrade) are removed
   from code blocks and marked in prose — that tooling is not part of the OS (state → `agylite plan`/`events`).
3. Verification policy (engineering/testing/codebase capabilities): lines that describe browser or screenshot
   verification steps are annotated with the local test-first policy (config/verification.yaml).

Deterministic and idempotent; every change is reported in the file's build notes.
