  every one-way door, `router.back()` must not re-enter the old route; deep links resolve with a real stack.
- **Native controls, states, a11y** → React Native Testing Library: loading/empty/error states render, roles and
  labels are present, tap targets ≥ 44 pt (style assertions), rapid double taps submit once.
- **Theme and tokens** → unit tests over the theme module: one accent, one grey family, radii from the stated
  scale, both light and dark token sets complete.
- **Motion** → worklet/unit tests where testable (thresholds use distance OR velocity; Reduce Motion selects the
  cross-fade variant); frame-rate claims need a measured number from a profiler run, recorded as evidence.
- **Static** → `tsc --noEmit`, lint (incl. a11y lint rules), `expo export`/build succeeds.

Anything that only a human can judge on a device (feel, optical alignment) is reported as NOT_TESTED with the
reason, never as passed.

- [ ] Semantic colors: light + dark token sets complete (unit test)
- [ ] Safe areas via `react-native-safe-area-context` insets (no hard-coded notch numbers; lint/grep check)
- [ ] Long-content, empty, loading and error states designed and rendered in component tests
- [ ] Motion: purpose named per animation; Reduce Motion variant tested; frame-rate claims measured, not eyeballed
- [ ] All tap targets ≥ 44 pt; contrast passes in both themes (a11y assertions)
